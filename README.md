# Diabetes
This project uses neural networks to build a model on existing Diabetes data to predict whether a patient is positive or negative given particular symptoms and parameters
Deployment is carried with ShinyApps, and interactive UI allows the model to be easily consumed.
Using plumber, an API is also built and can be run locally and used for other purposes (i.e., integrating with other programs and servers )
